Hi everyone,

I have some exciting news to share with you all! A few days ago, I wrote a post about my challenges with http-client mgems in mruby, and I described the work I did with my library `mruby-smallhttp`. To my surprise, this post was featured in Ruby Weekly 343, and I want to express my gratitude to the Ruby Weekly team!

Ruby Weekly is a free weekly newsletter that curates a roundup of Ruby news and articles, and it is a must-read for all Ruby lovers. The newsletter covers everything from tutorials, videos, and podcasts, to events, job postings, and open-source projects. It's a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest trends, best practices, and new releases in the Ruby world.

I was thrilled to see my post featured in Ruby Weekly and to know that it reached a wider audience. The Ruby community is one of the most active and supportive communities out there, and Ruby Weekly is a testament to the power of this community. The newsletter is a great platform for sharing knowledge, building connections, and fostering collaboration.

If you haven't already, I highly recommend subscribing to Ruby Weekly. It's a great way to stay informed, learn something new, and connect with fellow Ruby enthusiasts. And, of course, I want to give a big shoutout to the Ruby Weekly team for their hard work and dedication in creating such a valuable resource for the community.

Thank you, Ruby Weekly, and thank you to the entire Ruby community for your ongoing support and inspiration.

Best regards,
[Your name]
